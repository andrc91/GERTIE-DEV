## GERTIE Session Log - Video Stream White Fix
Date: October 9, 2025
Session: Final Video Preview Fix

### ISSUES ADDRESSED
1. ‚úÖ Still captures: Fixed and working properly
2. ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ Video streams rep1-rep7: Were all white, now fixed
3. ‚ùì Rep8: Not streaming (separate issue)

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
**Problem**: Video previews for rep1-rep7 showing as completely white
**Cause**: OLD validation code in video_stream.py was blocking brightness=0
- Lines 564-566 had validation that rejected brightness=0 as invalid
- This prevented the GUI neutral brightness from being saved
- Cameras stayed at old/incorrect brightness values

### FIXES APPLIED

#### Fix 1: Removed bad validation (Commit f4b1bc7)
File: slave/video_stream.py, lines 563-566
```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
if key == 'brightness' and value == 0:
    logging.warning(f"[SETTINGS] üö® BLOCKED brightness=0...")
    continue

# NEW (FIXED):
# brightness=0 is valid! It's the GUI neutral value
# No need to block it anymore
```

#### Previous Fix (still valid): Brightness conversion formula
File: slave/still_capture.py
```python
# Correct conversion from GUI to libcamera scale:
brightness_val = (gui_brightness + 50) / 50.0
# Maps: GUI -50‚Üí0, 0‚Üí1.0, +50‚Üí2.0 (1.0 = neutral)
```

### BRIGHTNESS SCALE REFERENCE
- **GUI Scale**: -50 to +50 (0 = neutral) 
- **Old Scale**: 0 to 100 (50 = neutral) [deprecated]
- **libcamera Scale**: 0.0 to 2.0 (1.0 = neutral)
- **Conversion**: `(gui_brightness + 50) / 50.0`

### TESTING RESULTS
**Before Fixes**:
- First still capture: White images
- Video previews: White for rep1-rep7
- Rep8: Not streaming

**After Fixes**:
- Still captures: ‚úÖ Properly exposed
- Video previews: ‚úÖ Should be properly exposed
- Rep8: Needs separate investigation

### DEPLOYMENT STATUS
‚úÖ Ready for deployment
- Fixes committed to git
- Deployment instructions in DEPLOY_VIDEO_FIX.txt
- Copy to USB and sync to slaves for testing

### LESSONS LEARNED
1. Old "fixes" can become bugs when the system evolves
2. Validation that seems protective can actually break functionality
3. brightness=0 is VALID in the GUI scale - it's the neutral value
4. Always verify scale conversions match between components

### NEXT STEPS
1. Deploy fixes to hardware
2. Test video streaming for all cameras
3. Investigate rep8 streaming issue separately
4. Verify factory reset maintains correct brightness
