## CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Transform Analysis Complete

### What I Found:
1. **Transforms do NOT modify brightness** - The `apply_unified_transforms` functions only do:
   - Geometric transforms (crop, rotate, flip)
   - Color space conversions (RGBâ†”BGR, grayscale)
   - NO brightness/exposure adjustments in image data

2. **Brightness should ONLY be applied at camera hardware level** via `picam2.set_controls()`

3. **The fixes we applied:**
   - Added missing `picam2.set_controls()` calls in both video_stream.py and still_capture.py
   - This SHOULD have fixed the issue but it DIDN'T

### The Real Problem Must Be:
Since the white preview persists even after adding `picam2.set_controls()`, one of these must be happening:

1. **Controls are being overridden** - Something else is resetting the camera controls after we set them
2. **Control format is wrong** - The control dictionary format might be incorrect
3. **Hardware timing issue** - Controls need to be applied at a different point
4. **Default camera settings** - The camera's auto-exposure might be fighting our brightness settings

Let me search for any code that might be overriding or resetting camera controls...
