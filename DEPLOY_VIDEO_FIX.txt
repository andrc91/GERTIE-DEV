## VIDEO STREAM FIX DEPLOYMENT
Date: October 9, 2025 - FINAL FIX

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S BEEN FIXED
1. **Still Captures**: Working correctly ‚úÖ
2. **Video Streams rep1-rep7**: Fixed white preview issue 
   - Removed bad validation that blocked brightness=0
   - brightness=0 is the correct GUI neutral value
3. **Rep8**: Already has correct settings

### üîß CHANGES MADE
**Commit f4b1bc7 - slave/video_stream.py**
- Lines 563-566: Removed OLD validation that was blocking brightness=0
- This validation was incorrectly preventing the neutral brightness from being saved
- The brightness conversion formula was already correct

### üì¶ DEPLOYMENT STEPS
1. Copy entire `camera_system_integrated_final` folder to USB drive
2. On control1 Pi:
   ```bash
   # Copy from USB to Pi
   cp -r /media/usb/camera_system_integrated_final /home/andrc1/
   
   # Deploy to all slaves
   cd /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
   ./sync_to_slaves.sh
   ```
3. Launch GUI for testing:
   ```bash
   ./run_gui_with_logging.sh
   ```

### üß™ TEST PROCEDURE
1. Start video streams (System ‚Üí Start All Video Streams)
2. **Verify**: Video previews should show normal exposure (NOT white)
3. Send factory reset (System ‚Üí Reset All Cameras)
4. **Verify**: Video previews remain normal exposure
5. Capture still images
6. **Verify**: Still images have proper exposure

### üìä EXPECTED RESULTS
**Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Video streams rep1-rep7: White/overexposed
- ‚úÖ Still captures: Properly exposed

**After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Video streams rep1-rep7: Properly exposed
- ‚úÖ Still captures: Properly exposed
- ‚úÖ Factory reset maintains correct exposure

### üö® IF ISSUES PERSIST
The problem is likely old settings files on the Pis with incorrect brightness values.

**Manual Fix:**
```bash
# On each Pi (rep1-rep7), check settings:
cat /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final/rep*_settings.json

# If brightness is not 0, manually fix:
echo '{"brightness": 0, "contrast": 50, "saturation": 50}' > /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final/rep1_settings.json
# Repeat for each rep

# Then restart services:
sudo systemctl restart video_stream.service
sudo systemctl restart still_capture.service
```

### üìù TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Root Cause**: Old validation code from an earlier bug fix was blocking brightness=0, thinking it was invalid. However, brightness=0 is the correct neutral value in the GUI scale (-50 to +50).

**Brightness Scale Mapping**:
- GUI Scale: -50 to +50 (0 = neutral)
- libcamera Scale: 0.0 to 2.0 (1.0 = neutral)
- Conversion: `(gui_brightness + 50) / 50.0`

### ‚úÖ READY TO DEPLOY!
Copy folder to USB and test on hardware.
