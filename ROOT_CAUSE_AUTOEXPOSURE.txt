## ðŸš¨ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - Auto-Exposure is Fighting Our Brightness Control!

### The Real Problem:
**Auto-Exposure (AeEnable) is NOT being disabled in the camera controls!**

When auto-exposure is ON (default), the camera automatically adjusts exposure to maintain what it thinks is the "correct" brightness, which:
1. Overrides our manual brightness settings
2. Causes the white/overexposed images
3. Makes manual reset ineffective (camera keeps auto-adjusting back)

### Why This Happened:
- The convert_settings_to_camera_controls() function sets various controls BUT never sets "AeEnable": False
- Without explicitly disabling auto-exposure, the camera defaults to AUTO mode
- Auto-exposure fights any manual brightness adjustment we make

### The Fix Required:
We need to explicitly disable auto-exposure when brightness is being manually controlled.

Add to camera_controls:
```python
controls["AeEnable"] = False  # Disable auto-exposure to allow manual brightness control
```

This explains why:
- Manual resets don't work (auto-exposure re-adjusts)
- Everything is white (auto-exposure is overcompensating)
- The problem got worse over time (auto-exposure adapting to our changes)
