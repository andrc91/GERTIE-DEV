ðŸš¨ CRITICAL AUTO-EXPOSURE FIX - DEPLOY NOW ðŸš¨
===========================================

## âš¡ THE REAL ROOT CAUSE FOUND:
Auto-Exposure (AeEnable) was ON by default and fighting our brightness settings!

The camera was automatically adjusting exposure to compensate for any brightness changes we made, causing:
- White/overexposed video previews
- White still captures
- Manual resets not working (auto-exposure would re-adjust)

## ðŸ”§ WHAT WE FIXED:
Added `controls["AeEnable"] = False` to BOTH:
- `/slave/video_stream.py` (line 283)
- `/slave/still_capture.py` (line 373)

This disables auto-exposure and allows our manual brightness control to work properly.

## ðŸ“¦ DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. Copy this folder to USB drive
2. Deploy to rep8 using your standard process
3. The sync script will propagate to rep1-rep7
4. Services will restart with auto-exposure DISABLED

## âœ… EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Video previews: Properly exposed (no more white!)
- Still captures: Correct brightness on first capture
- Manual brightness adjustments: Will work immediately
- Factory reset: Will properly reset to brightness=0

## ðŸŽ¯ WHY THIS WILL WORK:
Previous attempts only fixed formulas and settings, but auto-exposure was overriding everything.
Now with auto-exposure disabled, our manual brightness settings will actually take effect!

## ðŸ§ª TEST AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
1. Check video preview - should show normal exposure
2. Capture a still - should be properly exposed
3. Try manual brightness adjustment - should see immediate effect
4. Try factory reset - should reset to neutral brightness

This is THE fix for the persistent white image issue! ðŸš€
