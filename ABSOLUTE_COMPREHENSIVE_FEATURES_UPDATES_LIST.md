## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: WYSIWYG SYSTEM BROKEN

### HIGHEST PRIORITY - SYSTEM SCIENTIFICALLY INVALID

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Different aspect ratios between preview and capture

| Component | Resolution | Aspect Ratio | Result |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Video Preview | 640x480 | 4:3 | Cropped view |
| Still Capture | 4608x2592 | 16:9 | Full sensor |

**Impact**: Preview shows DIFFERENT field of view than captured image  
**Scientific Implication**: System cannot be used for research-grade imaging  
**Status**: BLOCKS ALL PRODUCTION USE

**Required Fixes**:
1. Match preview aspect ratio to 16:9 (640x360 or 854x480)
2. Implement proportional coordinate scaling for crop
3. Add scaling logic between preview (640px) and sensor (4608px)

---

## PART 1: CRITICAL SYSTEM ISSUES (PRODUCTION BLOCKERS)

### 1.1 WYSIWYG SYNCHRONIZATION [CRITICAL - NEW DISCOVERY]

**Issue**: Preview does not match capture due to aspect ratio mismatch

**Sub-Issues**:
- [ ] Preview is 4:3, sensor is 16:9 - different FOV
- [ ] Crop coordinates don't scale between resolutions
- [ ] No proportional scaling logic exists
- [ ] Transform coordinates applied incorrectly

**Implementation**:
```python
# Required: Coordinate scaling function
def scale_crop_for_preview(crop, preview_res, sensor_res):
    scale_x = preview_res[0] / sensor_res[0] 
    scale_y = preview_res[1] / sensor_res[1]
    return {
        'x': int(crop['x'] * scale_x),
        'y': int(crop['y'] * scale_y), 
        'width': int(crop['width'] * scale_x),
