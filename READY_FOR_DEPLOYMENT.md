# READY FOR DEPLOYMENT - Summary

**Date Prepared**: 2025-10-06  
**Branch**: fix/wysiwyg-aspect-ratio  
**Status**: Ready for USB transfer and deployment

---

## What's Changed

### Code Fix
- **File**: `slave/video_stream.py` (line 149)
- **Change**: Preview resolution changed from 640x480 (4:3) to 640x360 (16:9)
- **Purpose**: Fix WYSIWYG aspect ratio mismatch between preview and capture
- **Impact**: Preview will now show same field of view as final captured images

### Infrastructure Added
- **sync_to_slaves.sh**: Automated deployment script
- **run_gui_with_logging.sh**: GUI testing with comprehensive logging
- **DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md**: Complete workflow documentation

## Tomorrow's Workflow

### 1. Transfer to control1 (Morning)
```bash
# On MacBook:
# Copy camera_system_incremental to USB drive

# On control1:
# Copy from USB to /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
cd /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
chmod +x sync_to_slaves.sh run_gui_with_logging.sh
```

### 2. Deploy to All Cameras
```bash
./sync_to_slaves.sh
```
This will:
- Sync code to all 8 cameras (7 remote + 1 local)
- Restart all services
- Log everything to `/home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt`

Expected time: 3-5 minutes

### 3. Test WYSIWYG Fix
```bash
./run_gui_with_logging.sh
```

**What to test:**
1. Launch GUI - all 8 camera previews should appear
2. **Check aspect ratio**: Previews should look wider (16:9 not 4:3)
3. Capture an image from any camera
4. Compare preview to captured image file
5. **Expected result**: Field of view should match exactly

### 4. Document Results
Make notes about:
- Did previews look correct (wider, 16:9)?
- Did preview match captured image?
- Any errors in GUI?
- Any cameras not working?
- System performance/lag?

### 5. Transfer Log Back
```bash
# On control1:
cp /home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt /media/usb/

# On MacBook:
# Copy from USB to Desktop
# Upload to Claude for analysis
```

## Git Status

### Current Branch
```
fix/wysiwyg-aspect-ratio
```

### Commits Ready
1. `540db73` - WYSIWYG Fix #1: Change preview aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9
2. `f018aaa` - Add deployment and logging infrastructure

### Master Branch
Still on baseline (no changes deployed yet)

---

## Expected Outcomes

### If Test PASSES ✅
- Previews are 16:9 aspect ratio
- Preview field of view matches captured images
- **Next step**: Fix coordinate scaling for crop feature
- **Timeline**: Continue with time sync and counters (1-2 days)

### If Test FAILS ❌
- Previews may look stretched or distorted
- GUI layout may need adjustment for new aspect ratio
- **Next step**: Analyze updatelog.txt and adjust
- **Timeline**: Debug based on specific issues found

## Quick Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
```bash
# Check connectivity to slaves
for ip in 201 202 203 204 205 206 207; do
    ping -c 1 192.168.0.$ip
done

# View deployment log
tail -50 /home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt
```

### If GUI won't start:
```bash
# Check if services are running
systemctl status video_stream.service

# View recent errors
grep ERROR /home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt | tail -20
```

### If previews look wrong:
- Take screenshot of GUI
- Capture an image
- Compare side-by-side
- Note in updatelog.txt what looks wrong

## Critical Success Criteria

This deployment is successful if:
1. All 8 camera previews display in GUI
2. Previews are visibly wider (16:9 instead of 4:3)
3. No new errors appear in logs
4. System remains stable during testing
5. Preview field of view matches captured image field of view

If ANY camera preview matches the captured image field of view, the fix is working.
If field of view still doesn't match, we need the log file to debug.

## Contact Points for Analysis

When you return with updatelog.txt, I need:
1. The complete updatelog.txt file
2. A screenshot of the GUI (if possible)
3. A sample captured image (if possible)
4. Your notes about what you observed

I'll analyze:
- Deployment success/failure patterns
- Service status and errors
- GUI behavior and output
- Network communication issues
- Any Python exceptions or errors

---

## Notes

- This is fix #1 of many for WYSIWYG
- Even if this partially works, it's progress
- The logging system will help us debug any issues quickly
- Each deployment appends to the same log file (continuous record)
- Git history preserved for all changes

**Ready to deploy**: Yes  
**Risk level**: Low (only changes preview resolution, doesn't affect capture)  
**Reversibility**: High (can revert via git or restore from backup)
