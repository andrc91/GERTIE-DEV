========================================
EMERGENCY ROLLBACK - DEPLOY NOW
========================================
Date: $(date)
Commit: 366b45b
Status: READY FOR HARDWARE TEST

WHAT HAPPENED:
--------------
- System got progressively worse through the day
- rep1-7 completely broken (white images, no video)
- rep8 (local) still works fine
- Diagnosis: Code drift from GOLDEN REFERENCE caused all issues

WHAT WAS FIXED:
---------------
✓ Restored EXACT GOLDEN REFERENCE code (zero modifications)
✓ Removed conflicting jpeg_quality values
✓ Removed unproven timing changes  
✓ Removed quality reduction experiments
✓ Files now BYTE-FOR-BYTE match with proven working baseline

VERIFICATION:
-------------
$ diff GOLDEN_REFERENCE_DO_NOT_TOUCH/slave/video_stream.py camera_system_integrated_final/slave/video_stream.py
  → No differences (EXACT MATCH ✓)

$ diff GOLDEN_REFERENCE_DO_NOT_TOUCH/slave/still_capture.py camera_system_integrated_final/slave/still_capture.py
  → No differences (EXACT MATCH ✓)

WHY THIS WILL WORK:
-------------------
1. rep8 works = Hardware is fine
2. GOLDEN REFERENCE = Proven working code
3. Code drift = Root cause of failures
4. Exact match = All drift removed

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
-----------------
1. Copy camera_system_integrated_final to USB
2. On control1: Copy to /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
3. Run: cd /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
4. Run: ./sync_to_slaves.sh
5. Run: ./run_gui_with_logging.sh
6. Test: Start video streams on all cameras
7. Test: Capture stills from all cameras
8. Copy /home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt to USB
9. Return to MacBook for analysis

EXPECTED RESULTS:
-----------------
✓ All 8 cameras show video preview
✓ All 8 cameras capture non-white images
✓ File sizes normal (not tiny)
✓ No "Message too long" socket errors
✓ System behaves like original working version

IF IT WORKS:
------------
- We have proven baseline restored
- Can start making small, tested changes again
- Each change validated before next one

IF IT STILL FAILS:
------------------
- Hardware issue (network, camera, Pi)
- Not a software problem
- Check physical connections, camera modules

SESSION LOG:
------------
Full context: /Users/andrew1/Desktop/GERTIE_SESSION_LOG.md

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH
This is the proven working code that was validated in QA.
No experimental changes, no modifications, pure baseline.
