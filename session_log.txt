## CRITICAL AUTO-EXPOSURE FIX DISCOVERED AND APPLIED

### Timeline:
1. **Initial Problem:** White video streaming previews and still captures
2. **First Fix Attempt:** Added missing picam2.set_controls() calls - didn't work
3. **User Insight:** Suspected transform settings issue
4. **Transform Analysis:** Confirmed transforms don't modify brightness (correct)
5. **ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** Auto-Exposure (AeEnable) was ON by default!

### The Real Problem:
- Auto-exposure was automatically adjusting camera exposure
- This was fighting/overriding our manual brightness settings
- Caused persistent white/overexposed images
- Made manual resets ineffective

### The Solution Applied:
- Added `controls["AeEnable"] = False` to disable auto-exposure
- Applied to both video_stream.py and still_capture.py
- Now manual brightness control will work properly

### Files Modified:
- `/slave/video_stream.py` - Added AeEnable=False to build_camera_controls()
- `/slave/still_capture.py` - Added AeEnable=False to build_camera_controls()

### Deployment Status:
- Changes committed to git
- Ready for USB deployment to rep8
- Will sync to rep1-rep7 automatically

### Expected Outcome:
With auto-exposure disabled, manual brightness settings will finally take effect properly.
Video previews and still captures should show correct exposure immediately after deployment.
