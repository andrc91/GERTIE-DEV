# DEPLOYMENT via sync_to_slaves.sh ONLY

Date: 2025-10-14 18:20:00
Commits: 
- 81cc7af Feature: Play shutter sound for each camera during Capture All (8 sounds for 8 cameras)
- c3997e0 Fix: Platform-aware audio playback - use aplay on Linux, afplay on macOS

## ENHANCEMENT: Per-Camera Audio Feedback

### What Changed:
âœ… **Capture All** now plays shutter.wav sound for EACH camera (8 times)
âœ… Platform fix ensures audio works on Raspberry Pi (aplay)
âœ… Individual captures still play single sound (unchanged)

### User Experience Improvement:
**Before**: Click "Capture All" â†’ hear 1 shutter sound at start
**After**: Click "Capture All" â†’ hear 8 rapid shutter sounds (burst mode)

Each sound corresponds to one camera capturing, giving clear audible feedback for the multi-camera capture sequence.

### MANDATORY STEPS (NO ALTERNATIVES):
1. Copy camera_system_integrated_final to USB
2. On control1: cp -r /media/USB/camera_system_integrated_final /home/andrc1/
3. cd /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
4. ./sync_to_slaves.sh
5. ./run_gui_with_logging.sh
6. Test Enhanced Audio Feature (see below)
7. cp /home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt /media/USB/
8. Return updatelog.txt to MacBook

## Testing Procedure:

### 1. Verify Audio Works (Platform Fix):
```bash
# Manual test on control1:
aplay /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final/master/shutter.wav
# Should hear shutter sound âœ…
```

### 2. Test Capture All Enhancement:
- Launch GUI: ./run_gui_with_logging.sh
- Settings â†’ Application Preferences â†’ Verify "Enable Audio Feedback" is checked
- Click **"Capture All Cameras"** button
- **Expected**: Hear **8 RAPID SHUTTER SOUNDS** in sequence over ~0.8 seconds ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ
- Each sound = one camera capturing
- Should feel like professional burst/sequence capture

### 3. Test Individual Capture (Unchanged):
- Click individual "Capture" button on any camera
- **Expected**: Hear **1 SHUTTER SOUND** per button press
- This behavior is unchanged from previous version

### 4. Test Settings:
- Uncheck "Enable Audio Feedback" â†’ captures should be silent
- Re-check "Enable Audio Feedback" â†’ should hear test sound + captures have sound again
- Close/reopen GUI â†’ setting should persist

## Expected Result:
âœ… **Capture All**: 8 shutter sounds (one per camera) - burst mode feedback
âœ… **Individual Capture**: 1 shutter sound per button press
âœ… **Platform Compatibility**: Works on Raspberry Pi using aplay
âœ… **Settings**: Audio can be toggled on/off, persists across restarts
âœ… **Non-blocking**: Captures don't wait for sounds to finish

## Technical Details:
- **Capture All Sequence**: 8 cameras Ã— (audio + CAPTURE_STILL + 0.1s delay)
- **Total Duration**: ~0.8 seconds for full sequence
- **Audio Command**: `aplay -q /path/to/shutter.wav` on Linux
- **Sound Timing**: Plays BEFORE each capture command (good UX)
- **Non-blocking**: subprocess.Popen with DEVNULL redirects

## Behavior Summary:

| Action | Audio Behavior | Count |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Capture All** | Rapid burst of sounds | 8 sounds |
| **Individual Capture** | Single sound | 1 sound |
| **Settings Toggle** | Test sound on enable | 1 sound |

## Troubleshooting:
If audio doesn't work, see previous deployment instructions (e063f25) for:
- Audio hardware checks (`aplay -l`, `amixer`)
- Volume settings
- File existence verification
- Log analysis

## DO NOT:
- Use any other deployment method
- Run individual scp commands
- Modify sync_to_slaves.sh

## Change History:
- **54f73b8**: Added audio to individual captures (1 sound per button)
- **c3997e0**: Platform fix - aplay on Linux (CRITICAL BUG FIX)
- **81cc7af**: Enhanced Capture All - 8 sounds for 8 cameras (THIS DEPLOYMENT)
