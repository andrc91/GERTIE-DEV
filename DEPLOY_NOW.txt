# DEPLOYMENT via sync_to_slaves.sh ONLY

Commit: 6bb8aad - Fix: Replace broken slaves lookup with exclusive_ip direct comparison

## CRITICAL: Previous Deployment Had TOTAL VIDEO FAILURE
The last deployment (d5e8d40) caused AttributeError on EVERY frame:
- Error: 'MasterVideoGUI' object has no attribute 'slaves'
- Result: NO VIDEO DISPLAYED AT ALL - completely black screens
- Not just a resize issue - video was completely broken!

## THIS DEPLOYMENT FIXES THE ATTRIBUTE ERROR
Changed from broken `self.gui.slaves` lookup to direct `exclusive_ip` comparison

## MANDATORY STEPS (NO ALTERNATIVES):
1. Copy camera_system_integrated_final to USB
2. On control1: cp -r /media/USB/camera_system_integrated_final /home/andrc1/
3. cd /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
4. ./sync_to_slaves.sh
5. ./run_gui_with_logging.sh
6. Test:
   - FIRST: Verify video streams show from all 8 cameras (was broken before!)
   - Press keys 1-8: Each camera should enlarge to 960x720
   - Press 0: Return to grid with all at 320x240
   - Verify smooth transitions, no AttributeError in logs
7. cp /home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt /media/USB/
8. Return updatelog.txt to MacBook

## Expected Result:
✅ Video streams ACTUALLY VISIBLE (were broken in d5e8d40!)
✅ No more AttributeError spam in logs
✅ Exclusive mode: Video enlarges to 960x720 (3x normal)
✅ Grid mode: All videos at 320x240
✅ Smooth transitions between modes

## Fixed Issues:
1. AttributeError: Removed broken self.gui.slaves lookup
2. Now uses direct exclusive_ip comparison (cleaner, faster)
3. Both exclusive_camera name and IP stored for efficient checking

## DO NOT:
- Use any other deployment method
- Run individual scp commands
- Modify sync_to_slaves.sh
