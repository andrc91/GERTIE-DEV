Commit: 9044cee - Fix: Set exclusive_camera state variable for video resize detection

## MANDATORY STEPS (NO ALTERNATIVES):
1. Copy camera_system_integrated_final to USB drive
2. On control1 Pi: cp -r /media/USB/camera_system_integrated_final /home/andrc1/
3. cd /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
4. ./sync_to_slaves.sh
5. ./run_gui_with_logging.sh
6. Test: Start video streams
7. Test: Press keys 1-8 to enter exclusive mode - **VIDEO MUST VISIBLY ENLARGE**
8. Test: Verify video is SHARP in exclusive mode (not blurry/pixelated)
9. Test: Press 0 to return to grid - verify videos return to normal size
10. Test: Capture images in both modes
11. cp /home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt /media/USB/
12. Return updatelog.txt to MacBook for analysis

## CRITICAL FIX DETAILS:
**Root Problem**: The exclusive_camera state variable was NEVER being set by the GUI!

**What Was Happening**:
1. Previous deployment (b8c75a1) included video resize logic in network_manager.py
2. This logic checked: "if self.gui.exclusive_camera == camera_name, resize to 960x720"
3. BUT gui_base.py NEVER set self.exclusive_camera = camera_name
4. Result: Resize check always failed, video stayed 320x240
5. Frame got bigger (visual container), but video inside stayed small

**The Complete Solution** (2 commits):
- **Commit 9eaceb2**: Removed double-resize quality issue (deployed in b8c75a1)
- **Commit 9044cee**: Added missing state variable assignments (THIS DEPLOYMENT)

**Files Changed in This Deployment**: master/camera_gui/core/gui_base.py
  - Line 251: `self.exclusive_camera = camera_name` (set when entering exclusive)
  - Line 270: `self.exclusive_camera = None` (clear when returning to grid)

**How It Works Now**:
1. User presses number key (e.g., 5 for rep5)
2. show_exclusive_preview() called
3. **NEW**: Sets `self.exclusive_camera = 'rep5'`
4. Frame enlarges to span grid
5. Video frames processed by network_manager
6. Checks: "Is 192.168.0.205 the IP for rep5?" → YES
7. Checks: "Is rep5 == self.exclusive_camera?" → YES
8. **Resizes video to 960x720** (3x normal size)
9. User presses 0 to exit
10. **NEW**: Sets `self.exclusive_camera = None`
11. Videos return to 320x240

## Expected Result:
✓ Video streaming visible from all cameras (rep1-rep8)
✓ **CRITICAL: Pressing keys 1-8 makes video ENLARGE and SHARP**
✓ Video fills the exclusive frame (not small in a big frame)
✓ Quality is high in exclusive mode (suitable for manual focusing)
✓ Pressing 0 returns all videos to normal 320x240 size
✓ Smooth transitions between modes
✓ Capture works in both grid and exclusive modes

## VISUAL VERIFICATION:
**Grid Mode** (press 0):
- 8 small video previews (320x240 each)
- All cameras visible simultaneously

**Exclusive Mode** (press 1-8):
- ONE large video preview filling most of screen
- **VIDEO MUST BE VISIBLY LARGER** (not just the frame)
- Sharp enough to manually focus camera
- Text/details clearly visible

## WHY PREVIOUS DEPLOYMENT FAILED:
Previous deployment (b8c75a1) had the resize CODE but missing the STATE TRACKING.
It's like having a light switch (resize logic) but no way to turn it on (state variable).

## TESTING PRIORITY:
1. **CRITICAL**: Press number key, verify VIDEO enlarges (not just frame)
2. **CRITICAL**: Verify enlarged video is sharp/clear (high quality)
3. Verify grid mode still works normally
4. Test state transitions: grid → exclusive → grid → different exclusive
5. Verify capture works in both modes

## DO NOT:
- Use any other deployment method besides sync_to_slaves.sh
- Skip visual verification that VIDEO (not frame) enlarges
- Proceed without testing multiple cameras in exclusive mode
- Assume it works without confirming size change

## IF VIDEO STILL DOESN'T ENLARGE:
This would indicate a different issue. Check:
1. Verify commit 9044cee is actually deployed (git log on control1)
2. Check if GUI code was properly copied to control1
3. Look for Python errors in GUI output related to exclusive_camera
4. Return updatelog.txt with detailed GUI logs

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ All 8 cameras show live video preview
✅ **Pressing number keys makes VIDEO visibly enlarge** (fills frame)
✅ **Enlarged video is SHARP and HIGH QUALITY**
✅ Pressing 0 makes videos return to small size
✅ Smooth mode transitions without errors
✅ Capture works in both modes
✅ No errors in updatelog.txt

## TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
This fix completes the exclusive mode video enlargement feature by connecting two pieces:
1. Resize logic in network_manager.py (from commit 9eaceb2, already deployed)
2. State tracking in gui_base.py (from commit 9044cee, THIS deployment)

Together they enable the video stream to know when to resize itself based on which camera
is currently in exclusive view. Without both pieces, the resize logic exists but never
activates because it can't detect exclusive mode.
