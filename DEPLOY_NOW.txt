Commit: 440aa8a (Architectural Fix #2: Rep8 thread synchronization)

## CRITICAL: ARCHITECTURAL FIXES - NOT PARAMETER TUNING
Previous fixes (commits 7b25c2c, 2e80141) addressed symptoms, not root causes.
These architectural fixes address fundamental design flaws in thread coordination.

## WHAT CHANGED:
**Fix #1 (185c628): GUI Event Queue Gating**
- Problem: 240 after_idle() calls/sec queued even with rate limiting
- Solution: Gate calls BEFORE queuing using update_pending flag
- Impact: 90% reduction in Tkinter event loop processing

**Fix #2 (440aa8a): Rep8 Thread Synchronization**  
- Problem: No synchronization between streaming/capture Picamera2 instances
- Solution: threading.Event() for proper cleanup sequencing
- Impact: Eliminates "camera already open" conflicts

## MANDATORY STEPS (NO ALTERNATIVES):
1. Copy camera_system_integrated_final to USB
2. On control1: cp -r /media/USB/camera_system_integrated_final /home/andrc1/
3. cd /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final
4. ./sync_to_slaves.sh
5. ./run_gui_with_logging.sh
6. **CRITICAL TESTING** (see below)
7. cp /home/andrc1/Desktop/updatelog.txt /media/USB/
8. Return updatelog.txt to MacBook

## CRITICAL TESTING PROTOCOL:

### Test #1: Rep8 Freeze Fix (PRIORITY: CRITICAL)
**Objective**: Verify Rep8 video stream reliably resumes after capture

**Steps**:
1. Start GUI, wait for all 8 cameras streaming
2. Click "Capture All" button
3. Watch rep8 (bottom-right) - should pause during capture
4. **Count seconds** - should resume within 5-10 seconds automatically
5. Verify rep8 video is live and smooth (not frozen/stuttering)
6. Repeat capture 5 more times (total 6 captures)
7. Each time: rep8 should pause then auto-resume

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
‚úÖ Rep8 video resumes automatically after EVERY capture (6/6)
‚úÖ Resume time: 5-10 seconds consistently
‚úÖ Video quality: smooth, not frozen or stuttering
‚úÖ No "camera already open" errors in log

**FAILURE INDICATORS**:
‚ùå Rep8 stays frozen after any capture
‚ùå Resume takes >15 seconds
‚ùå Video stutters or shows errors after resume
‚ùå "camera already open" or Picamera2 errors in log

### Test #2: GUI Responsiveness Fix (PRIORITY: CRITICAL)
**Objective**: Verify GUI is dramatically more responsive

**Steps**:
1. Start GUI with all 8 cameras streaming in grid mode
2. Move mouse around the window - observe smoothness
3. Rapidly click between different camera views (exclusive mode)
4. Click "Capture All" - observe button response time
5. While streaming, try other buttons - should be instant
6. Check system monitor - CPU usage should be lower than before

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
‚úÖ Mouse movement: smooth, no lag or jitter
‚úÖ Button clicks: instant response (<100ms perceived delay)
‚úÖ Camera switching: immediate transition, no freeze
‚úÖ Grid view: smooth frame updates, not choppy
‚úÖ CPU usage: noticeably lower than previous deployment

**FAILURE INDICATORS**:
‚ùå Mouse lag when moving over GUI
‚ùå Button clicks take >500ms to respond
‚ùå Camera switching delayed or freezes GUI
‚ùå Grid view choppy or stuttering
‚ùå CPU usage same or higher than before

### Test #3: Reliability Test (PRIORITY: HIGH)
**Objective**: Verify system stability over 2-minute session

**Steps**:
1. Stream all 8 cameras for 30 seconds in grid mode
2. Switch to exclusive mode (different cameras) for 30 seconds
3. Perform 3 "Capture All" operations
4. Return to grid mode for final 30 seconds
5. Check for any errors, warnings, or crashes

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
‚úÖ All cameras stream continuously without dropping
‚úÖ No GUI freezes or hangs during any operation
‚úÖ All 3 captures complete successfully
‚úÖ No errors in updatelog.txt related to threading or Picamera2
‚úÖ System remains stable throughout 2-minute test

## Expected Result After Testing:

### If BOTH Tests #1 and #2 Pass:
üéâ **ARCHITECTURAL FIXES SUCCESSFUL**
- Rep8 freeze issue: RESOLVED (Event-based synchronization working)
- GUI lag issue: RESOLVED (Event queue gating working)
- System should feel dramatically more responsive
- Ready to move to other feature development

### If Test #1 Fails (Rep8 still freezes):
‚ö†Ô∏è Thread synchronization issue deeper than expected
Next investigation needed:
- Check if Events are being set/cleared correctly in log
- May need longer timeout periods
- May need module-level picam2 reference instead of local

### If Test #2 Fails (GUI still laggy):
‚ö†Ô∏è Bottleneck not in event queue, look at:
- Image decoding performance (JPEG decode time)
- PIL/PhotoImage creation overhead
- Tkinter rendering pipeline
- May need to move image processing to background threads

### If BOTH Tests Fail:
‚ö†Ô∏è Return updatelog.txt immediately for deep analysis
- May need profiling to find actual bottlenecks
- Consider alternative GUI framework (not Tkinter)
- May need hardware-level investigation (Pi performance)

## DO NOT:
- Use any other deployment method
- Run individual scp commands  
- Modify sync_to_slaves.sh
- Skip the critical testing protocol
- Deploy if any uncommitted changes exist

## NOTES:
- These are architectural fixes addressing root causes
- Previous parameter tuning (sleep times, rate limits) was insufficient
- Testing protocol designed to verify the architectural changes work
- Detailed logging will show Event timing for debugging if needed
