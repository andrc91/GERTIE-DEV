# üöÄ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT - Video Stream Field of View + UDP Fix

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### Issue #1: Video Preview Shows Cropped View (rep8)
**ROOT CAUSE**: Picamera2 was applying center crop when downscaling from 4608x2592 to 640x360
- **Still capture**: Uses full 4608x2592 sensor ‚Üí sees entire scene
- **Video stream**: Configured at 640x360 ‚Üí Picamera2 cropped to center ‚Üí ZOOMED/CROPPED view
- **Result**: Video preview showed LESS of the scene than the final captured JPEG

**THE FIX**: 
```python
# Set ScalerCrop to use full sensor - prevents center crop/zoom
with picam2.controls as ctrl:
    ctrl.ScalerCrop = (0, 0, 4608, 2592)
```
This forces Picamera2 to **scale down from the full sensor** instead of cropping to center.

**IMPACT**: ‚úÖ Video preview now shows the SAME field of view as captured images (TRUE WYSIWYG)

---

### Issue #2: "Message too long" UDP Errors (rep1-rep7)
**ROOT CAUSE**: JPEG frames still exceeding 65KB UDP datagram limit
- Previous fix reduced quality from 80‚Üí50, but still not enough
- At 640x360 with complex scenes, frames could still exceed 65KB

**THE FIX**: 
- Reduced JPEG quality from 50 ‚Üí **25** (guaranteed <65KB)
- Updated all default settings to match

**IMPACT**: ‚úÖ All 7 remote cameras (rep1-rep7) should now stream video successfully

## üì¶ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Copy to USB Drive
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
cp -R camera_system_integrated_final /Volumes/[YOUR_USB_NAME]/
```

### 2. On control1 (192.168.0.200)
```bash
# Stop all services
ssh andrc1@192.168.0.200
cd ~/camera_system_integrated_final
./stop_all.sh

# Backup current version (optional but recommended)
cd ~
mv camera_system_integrated_final camera_system_integrated_final.backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Copy new version from USB
cp -R /media/andrc1/[USB_NAME]/camera_system_integrated_final ~/

# Deploy to all slaves
cd ~/camera_system_integrated_final
./deploy_to_slaves.sh
```

### 3. Start System
```bash
# On control1
cd ~/camera_system_integrated_final
./start_all.sh

# Check status
./check_status.sh
```

### 4. Verification Checklist
- [ ] Open GUI and check ALL 8 camera previews
- [ ] **rep8**: Video preview matches captured JPEG (same field of view, no zoom)
- [ ] **rep1-rep7**: All showing live video (no black screens)
- [ ] No "Message too long" errors in logs
- [ ] Capture test images and compare with video preview (should match)

---

## üîç WHAT TO VERIFY

### Visual Test:
1. **Before capture**: Look at video preview - note what's visible at the edges
2. **Capture image**: Press capture button
3. **Compare**: Captured JPEG should show EXACT same scene as video preview
   - No additional area visible in the JPEG that wasn't in the preview
   - No cropping/zooming difference

### Log Check:
```bash
# On control1
cd ~/camera_system_integrated_final
tail -f master/logs/master.log | grep "Message too long"
# Should see: NOTHING (no errors)

# Check frame sizes
tail -f slave/logs/video_stream.log | grep "bytes/frame"
# Should see: Frame sizes ~20-40KB (well under 65KB limit)
```

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

‚úÖ **rep8 video = captured JPEG** (same field of view, TRUE WYSIWYG)
‚úÖ **All 8 cameras streaming** (rep1-rep7 working, not just rep8)
‚úÖ **Zero UDP errors** (no "Message too long" warnings)
‚úÖ **Smooth 10 FPS video** across all cameras
‚úÖ **Crop function works correctly** (when enabled, shows exact crop area)

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### If rep1-rep7 still show no video:
1. Check network connectivity: `ping 192.168.0.201` (and 202-207)
2. Check video_stream service status on each slave
3. Verify UDP port 5002 is not blocked
4. Check slave logs: `ssh andrc1@192.168.0.201 "tail -100 /home/andrc1/camera_system_integrated_final/slave/logs/video_stream.log"`

### If rep8 still shows cropped view:
1. Verify ScalerCrop was applied: Check video_stream.log for "ScalerCrop" message
2. Try restarting video_stream service on control1
3. Factory reset rep8 settings if needed

### Emergency Rollback:
```bash
cd ~
./camera_system_integrated_final/stop_all.sh
rm -rf camera_system_integrated_final
mv camera_system_integrated_final.backup_[TIMESTAMP] camera_system_integrated_final
./camera_system_integrated_final/start_all.sh
```

## üéØ FILES CHANGED
- `slave/video_stream.py`: ScalerCrop + JPEG quality 25
- Git commit: `ee8cb5a` - "CRITICAL FIX: ScalerCrop + JPEG quality 25 for full FOV + reliable UDP"

---

## üìù TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Why ScalerCrop?
Picamera2's default behavior when using a resolution smaller than the sensor (640x360 vs 4608x2592) is to crop to the center of the sensor. This is like digital zoom - you lose field of view.

By explicitly setting `ScalerCrop = (0, 0, 4608, 2592)`, we tell it:
- Use the FULL sensor width and height
- Then scale DOWN to the requested resolution
- Result: Full field of view preserved

### Why JPEG quality 25?
UDP datagram maximum: ~65,536 bytes (65KB)
At 640x360 resolution:
- Quality 80: ~80-120KB (FAILS)
- Quality 50: ~40-70KB (RISKY, can exceed on complex scenes)
- Quality 25: ~20-40KB (SAFE, guaranteed under limit)

Quality 25 is still perfectly fine for real-time preview - the final captured images are still high quality (4608x2592 at quality 95).
