## CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Rep8 vs Rep1-Rep7 Differences

### Rep8 (local_camera_slave.py) - WORKING:
- Does NOT set brightness controls when configuring camera
- Does NOT disable auto-exposure
- Only sets: `controls={"FrameRate": 15}` for video
- For stills: NO controls at all, just size configuration
- Result: Works perfectly!

### Rep1-Rep7 (video_stream.py/still_capture.py) - NOT WORKING:
- Explicitly sets brightness controls
- Now disables auto-exposure (our latest fix)
- Sets multiple controls: Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, etc.
- Result: White/overexposed images

### The Real Issue:
The slaves are OVER-CONTROLLING the camera! Rep8 works because it lets the camera use its defaults.

### Possible Problems:
1. **Brightness conversion formula might be wrong** 
   - Current: `(brightness + 50) / 50.0` â†’ gives 1.0 for GUI brightness=0
   - But maybe the camera expects different values?

2. **Setting controls too early or too often**
   - Rep8 doesn't set controls at all and works fine
   - Rep1-rep7 set controls in config AND after start

3. **Auto-exposure disable might be making it worse**
   - Rep8 leaves auto-exposure enabled (default)
   - Our fix disabled it for rep1-rep7

### Next Step:
Try matching rep8's approach - minimal camera control intervention!
